<!-- ## Remote Sensing & Image Processing Scientist

Research scientist in remote sensing and image processing with 15+ years of academic experience. My expertise lies in bridging computer vision with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) technology, alongside solid skills in machine learning and geospatial analysis.  

Previously, as a Senior SAR Scientist at Floodbase, I focused on flood mapping, contributing to disaster management and climate change mitigation. My passion lies in leveraging technology for societal betterment through research and innovation.  

From January 2022 to September 2023 I was a Senior SAR scientist at Floodbase, a US climate tech startup.

From September 2011 to August 2021, I was a Researcher at TU-Berlin (Technical University of Berlin) in the Computer Vision and Remote Sensing Group.

From November 2007 to January 2011, I was a Research Scientist at the Barcelona Media Research Center in Barcelona, Spain.

From March 2006 to October 2007, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow and stayed as an invited member with the Remote Sensing Laboratory, from the Signal Theory and Communications Department TSC, Universitat PolitÃ¨cnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Barcelona, Spain. I was also with the Geophysical Imagery team from the Geosciences Rennes Laboratory, University of Rennes 1, France. -->

I received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2002 and the Ph.D. degree in Signal Processing and Telecommunication in 2006, both from the University of Rennes 1, France.
